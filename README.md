# This is a fake drone tracking app as of now

It uses a local json file for the data.
It would be trivial to create a couple of sql tables and start a backend to serve
an equivalent json blob but the focus is just on visuals for now.


Useful dev commands

```sh
npm start  # Runs the app in the development mode.
npm test  # Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
npm run build  # Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
```
